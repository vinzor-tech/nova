upgrade:

  - A new ``use_neutron`` option is introduced which replaces the
    obtuse ``network_api_class`` option. This defaults to 'False' to
    match existing defaults, however if ``network_api_class`` is set
    to the known Neutron value Neutron networking will still be used
    as before.

deprecations:

  - Deprecate ``volume_api_class`` and ``network_api_class`` config
    options. We only have one sensible backend for either of
    these. These options will be removed and turned into constants in
    Newton.
